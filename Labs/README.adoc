== Lab 1: Discrete math review

Save your work in a file called `lab1.txt`.

=== Number representation

. Convert 1590 to binary.
. Convert 0b101110110 to decimal.
. Convert 0b1100 0000 0001 1010 0001 0101 1011 1010 1101 to hexadecimal.
. Convert 0b100 001 101 101 to octal.
. Convert 0o31337 to binary.
. Convert 0xBADF00D to binary and then to octal.
. Convert 0o6157 to binary and then to decimal.
. Convert 497 to binary. Then, use two's complement to convert 497 to -497 in binary.
. Convert 900.79 to binary up to the 1/16ths spot.
. Count from 0 through 10 in ternary (base 3). Note: the algorithm for counting is similar regardless of the number base. Show the place values.

=== Circuit design

. Let A and B be two 2-bit binary numbers (i.e., A1 A0 and B1 B0). Write out a truth table for A less than or equal to B. For example, 0b10 is less than or equal to 0b11, so the output for that row should be true.
. Write out the equivalent logic expression for the previous answer.
. Write out the truth table for the minority circuit (it's true when the minority of X, Y, and Z are true).
. Write out the equivalent logic expression for the previous answer.

=== Boolean algebra

Use the laws of Boolean algebra.

. Show c + (b * c)' = 1
. Show (a + c) * (a * d + a * d') + a * c + c = a + c
. Simplify a' * (a + b) + (b + a * a) * (a + b')
. Show (a' * b') + (a' * b) + (a * b') = (a * b)'

=== Dual form

Find the dual form.

. (a + b)' + c * a' + 1
. 1 + 1 * 0'

== Lab 2: Circuit implementation

Implement these circuits from lab 1 in three different ways:

. Window -> Combinational analysis
. 8-1 MUX
. ROM

The circuits:

. Let A and B be two 2-bit binary numbers (i.e., A1 A0 and B1 B0). Write out a truth table for A less than or equal to B. For example, 0b10 is less than or equal to 0b11, so the output for that row should be true.

. Minority circuit (it's true when the minority of inputs X, Y, and Z are true, or equivalently, most inputs are false).

Save your work in a file called `lab2.circ` in your `COMP1200-2016/Labs/` folder.

== Lab 3: State machine implementation

Implement a vending machine that accepts nickels, dimes and quarters.
It sells only one thing, but it's worth 25 cents.

The state-transition diagram (below) describes the vending machine.
Implicitly, the absence of additional coins implies that we remain in the same state.

. Answer these questions about the state machine above.
.. List all possible inputs. How many do we have?
.. List all possible states. How many do we have?
.. The outputs are: vend and return money (0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 cents).
.. How many bits for state will you need?
.. How many input bits will you need?
. Assign states to bits, inputs to bits and outputs to bits.
. Write out a state-transition table.
. How many bits will we need for ROM address?
. How many bits will we need for ROM data?
. Finally, use a ROM to implement said thing.

The table may look like this:

[cols="5",format="csv"]

state,input,next,vend,return
000,00,000,0,000
000,01,001,0,000
