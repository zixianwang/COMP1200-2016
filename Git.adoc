= Git Guide

In a way, Git is like Dropbox or Google Drive,
but its flexibility introduces complexity.
Hence this guide.
Git is available in the command line, as a standalone graphical interface, and is integrated in development tools such as Eclipse and Visual Studio.

== Installation

http://git-scm.com/download/[Download Git] for your platform.

[horizontal]
*Windows*:: Stick with the default options and click `Next` until finished.
*Mac OS X*:: Got an error? Try:
* Apple menu -> System Preferences... -> Security & Privacy -> Open Anyway.
* Otherwise, try: Spotlight Search (press `F4`) -> Terminal. Then, type `git` and follow instructions to install git.
*Linux*:: Use `sudo` with your package manager.

== Setup

Starterupper configures git for this class.
It is safe to run if you already use git.

First, open your terminal.

****
[horizontal]
*Windows*:: Windows key -> Git Bash
*Mac OS X*:: Spotlight Search (Press `F4`) -> Terminal
****

Then, copy/paste the entire command below into the terminal.

----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrancej/COMP1200-2016/master/main.sh | bash
----

[horizontal]
*Windows*:: `Ctrl-C` to copy, `Shift-Insert` to paste.

*Mac*:: `Command-C` to copy, `Command-V` to paste

== Git GUI usage

First, open Git GUI.

****
*Windows*: Windows key -> Git GUI

*Mac OS X*:

Spotlight Search (Press `F4`) -> Terminal

----
git gui
----

Next, go to the repository for this course.

. Open Existing Repository.
. Click Browse
. Choose `COMP1200-2016` in your home directory.
. Click Open

[TIP]
====
To get back again to this repository easily,

Click Repository -> Create Desktop Icon

|*To...*
|*... follow these steps:*

|*Submit work*

. Work
. Stage
. Commit
. Push
|*Work* within the course repository, or copy files into it.

*Stage* your work by selecting files to add to the commit (snapshot).

. Look for files listed under _Unstaged Changes_ (upper left panel) to stage.
. Click the file name to examine changes in the upper right panel.
. Click the icon to the left of the file you want to add.
. Notice that the file is now listed under _Staged Changes_ (lower left panel).

*Commit* to record a snapshot of the files you staged.

. Enter a description of what you did in the _Commit Message_ (lower right panel), such as `Finished lab 1`
. Click Commit

*Push* to upload commits to your remote repository.

. Click Push.

|*Confirm submission*

. Show history
. Locate `origin/master`
|*Show history* of commits.

. Click Repository -> Visualize All Branch History

*Locate `origin/master`* in the commit history to see when you last submitted work.
If it's at the top, you pushed successfully.
If it's missing (or not at the top), I don't have your latest changes, and you need to push.

|*Receive updates*

. Fetch
. Merge
. Check
|*Fetch* to download updates from me.

. Click Remote -> Fetch from -> All
. Click OK

*Merge* `upstream/master` to combine my updates with your work.

. Click Merge -> Local Merge...
. Click Tracking Branch
. Select `upstream/master` in the list.
. Click Merge

*Check* for errors to see if you need to fix anything.

Git GUI may complain that you are in the middle of a change.
Indeed, you should complete the current commit before starting a merge.
Stage and commit the file(s) and try to merge again.

Git GUI may warn about merge conflicts.
This means that we both made different changes to the same lines in _conflicting_ files.

To fix the merge conflict, follow the instructions described in the command line section.

== Command line usage

First, open your terminal.

****
[horizontal]
*Windows*:: Windows key -> Git Bash
*Mac OS X*:: Spotlight Search (Press `F4`) -> Terminal
****

Next, go to the course repository.

----
cd ~/COMP1200-2016

|*To...*
|*... follow these steps:*
|*Examine*

. Staging area
. Diffs

|*Examine the staging area* to get an overview of changes.

----
git status
----

The command above organizes changes into these categories:

*Changes to be committed*::
These _staged_ files will be part of the next snapshot or commit.
*Changes not staged for commit*::
These _tracked_ files have changed, but will not be part of the next snapshot or commit until you _stage_ (add) them.
*Untracked files*::
These files are in the working directory, but are not in the git repository, because you did not _stage_ (add) them to git yet.

*Examine diffs* to see _unstaged changes_ to files that git tracks:

----
git diff
----

To understand the output:

----
 This line is unchanged.
-This line is removed, and shown in red.
+This line is added, and shown in green.
----

|*Submit work*

. Work
. Stage
. Commit
. Push
|*Work* by saving or copying files inside the course repository.

*Stage* your work by selecting files to add to the next commit (snapshot).
Git _tracks changes_ to the files you stage.

****
To stage all files currently in the folder...

----
git add .
----

To stage `an_arbitrary_file`

----
git add an_arbitrary_file
----
****

*Commit* to record a snapshot of the files staged earlier, and describe what you did.

----
git commit -m "Finished lab 1"
----

[TIP]
====
You can stage and commit tracked files in one step:

----
git commit -am "Finished lab 1"
----
====

*Push* to upload commits to your remote repository.

----
git push origin master
----

|*Confirm submission*

. Show history
. Locate `origin/master`
|*Show history* of commits.

----
gitk --all &
----

*Locate `origin/master`* in the commit history to see when you last submitted work.
If it's at the top, you pushed successfully.
If it's missing (or not at the top), I don't have your latest changes, and you need to push.

|*Receive updates*

. Fetch
. Merge
. Check

|*Fetch* to download updates from me.

----
git fetch --all
----

*Merge* `upstream/master` to combine my updates with your work.

----
git merge upstream/master
----

[TIP]
====
To fetch and merge in one step:
----
git pull upstream master
----
====

*Check* the output for `errors` to see if you need fix anything.

Git may complain that a file `would be overwritten by merge.`
This means that you haven't _staged_ or _committed_ those file(s) yet,
and git is preventing you from losing that work.
Stage and commit the file(s), and try to merge again.

Git may warn about a merge `CONFLICT`.
This means that we both made different changes to the same lines in the _conflicting_ files.

Examine all conflicting file(s).
You will notice lines with `<<<<<<<` or `=======` or `>>>>>>>` that weren't there before.
These _merge conflict markers_ show where (and how) changes created conflict.
Although you may remove them manually, git has options to assist you.

If you want to keep your version of a `conflicting_file`

----
git checkout --ours conflicting_file
----

If you want to use my version of a `conflicting_file`

----
git checkout --theirs conflicting_file
----

If you want to mix and match changes, use a merge tool (installed separately).

----
git mergetool conflicting_file
----

Finally, to fix the merge conflict, stage and commit all conflicting files (after you've fixed them).
